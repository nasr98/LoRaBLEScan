# LoRaBLEScan

This repository contains the files relevant to my dissertation project, the LoRaWAN BLE Scanning and Locating system.
The LoRaWAN BLE Application directory contains the files relevant for the application used to visualize the scanned tags, 
whilst the Pycom code file contains the code relevant to the Pycom scanners used to scan the bluetooth tags in a 7m vicinity.
